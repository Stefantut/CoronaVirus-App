## CoronaVirus App - 2020

---

Iâ€™ve used Vanilla JS, fetchApi to retrieve API Data, Sass for styling and BEM for class names.

ðŸš€ I used CSS Grid and made it fully responsive without using media queries.\_\_
ðŸš€ The API updates every 5 minutes and all the items are created dynamically through JavaScript.
